Testing correctness of KdTree

Running 27 total tests.

In the tests below, we consider three classes of points and rectangles.

  * Non-degenerate points: no two points (or rectangles) share either an
                           x-coordinate or a y-coordinate

  * Distinct points:       no two points (or rectangles) share both an
                           x-coordinate and a y-coordinate

  * General points:        no restrictions on the x-coordinates or y-coordinates
                           of the points (or rectangles)

A point in an m-by-m grid means that it is of the form (i/m, j/m),
where i and j are integers between 0 and m (inclusive).
